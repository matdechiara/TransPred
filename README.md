# TRANSPRED
Predicting cell-cell horizontal transmission of antibiotics resistance from genome and phenome

## Overview: 
TransPred is a collaborative research program, funded by the European Joint Programming Initiative for Antimicrobial Resistance, that seeks to understand genetic factors that controls the horizontal transmission of antibiotic resistance between gram negative bacteria and to disclose drug targets whose inhibition would slow the spread of antibiotics resistance. The program sequences E. coli strains isolated from animals, the environment and patients and measures their capacity to resist antibiotics and transfer this resistance to other strains. Genes and alleles explaining these properties are identified by genome-wide association analysis and machine learning predictions and confirmed in experiments.  
 
## Background: 
Antibiotics resistance is an accelerating crisis in gram-negative bacteria. Horizontal transmission of antibiotic resistance factors combined with the selective pressure imposed by antibiotic use has facilitated a rapid spread of resistance between and within pathogenic bacterial species. Only few new antibiotics against gram-negatives are in clinical trials and resistance also to new antibiotics is predicted to spread rapidly upon clinical introduction. New approaches to this problem are sorely needed. 


Antibiotic resistance factors promote exclusion, evasion or inactivation of antibiotics, e.g. by encoding efflux pumps or enzymes that degrade an antibiotic (Blair, et al, 2015). Horizontal transmission of resistance cassettes occurs predominantly by conjugative elements that are copied and then exchanged between cells during bacterial conjugation. Conjugative elements contain genes that carry much of the vital information needed for their transfer to new strains and some of these genes have been studied. 
  
However, not all pairs of bacteria are equally likely to exchange conjugative elements carrying antibiotic resistance. Thus, variation in horizontal transmission depends not only on the genes carried by the conjugative elements but also on the genes on the chromosomes of the donor and recipient cells. Chromosomally encoded factors controlling horizontal transmission are likely to be less specific to particular conjugative elements and therefore to constitute better drug targets but are virtually unknown. The general lack of knowledge in this area means that we cannot design drugs to target horizontal transmission and we cannot predict how fast resistance to a particular antibiotic  will spread in bacterial population, such as in an infection.
